# Attached here is a list of topics I am going deeper into the better understand the ML foundations. 

- Linear Algebra solid
- Calculus solid
- Probability and Statistics solid for ML, need deeper for DL
  - Likely a class on stochastic processes
  - Perhaps another on theoretical statistics
- Discrete Math solid, strengthening through leetcode
- Optimization
  - Deeper into SGD
- Approximation Methods
  - Newton's Method
  - Convex functions, convex sets 
  
- Before Machine Learning: Basic optimization (like gradient descent), basic calculus (partial derivatives), and basic probability/statistics.

- Before Deep Learning: Go deeper into numerical optimization (like SGD), advanced calculus (Jacobian, Hessian), and non-convex optimization.

- Before Simulation: After ML and DL, focusing on stochastic processes, numerical methods, and optimization theory for handling constraints and probabilistic models.
