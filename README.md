## About

Optimization will likely be intertwined between project interests, but this branch will be my interpretation of technical topics, and general foundation in optimization tools to apply.
Such methods to explore applications directly would be: 
~ Hyperparameter tuning
~ ROC Curve Optimization
~ Cross-Validation


The first area would be spacial optimization and visualizing interconnectedness between grid components. In addition, it would be ensuring there are local and micro grids established in various locations that could minimize reliance on hydrocarbons.

Another application would be reducing peaks, finding combinations that result in peaks, and suggesting ways to create a smoother demand curve.

## Demo
