# Projects

This repository contains various projects learned in courses and my own interests. As this is the first branch in the learning sector, it will start as more of a foundation for energy, and the other branches may be moved here later.

## About

This section will include: sources with an annotated bibliography, my own thoughts, feature engineering, my ideal dataset (then if I can find an accessible one), and then bring in various branches off of this one, if it doesn't conflict with main.

## Demo



## Features (in this order of operations):

Guideline: [Machine Learning Steps](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorial/machine-learning-steps)

- Literature review, domain knowledge context **(commonly omitted, why get data and choose a project if some end goal is not in mind, this can be a guideline for the rest of the project)**
- Preprocess a dataset (clean, visualize, data quality)
- Feature Engineering
- Building a model
  - Iterating
  - Robustness checks
- Optimization, Parameter Tuning, Model Evaluation
  - Propagation
  - Regularization
- Implementations, Policy Analysis
- Applying an agent to help maintain, optimize, and other ways to expand once better understanding how those work.
  - Demand Charge Reductions, for example, DERs
  - Net Zero Management - control energy storage

## Project Branches

### Microgrid

This section includes projects focused on the design, optimization, and management of microgrids. Projects may include:
- Demand Charge Reductions
- Net Zero Management
- Control and optimization of distributed energy resources (DERs)
- Cybersecurity in microgrids

### Social Algorithms

This section includes projects related to the development and analysis of social algorithms. Projects may include:
- Social network analysis
- Influence maximization
- Recommendation systems
- Sentiment analysis

### Edge Computing

This section includes projects that involve edge computing technologies and applications. Projects may include:
- Real-time data processing at the edge
- IoT device management
- Edge AI applications
- Distributed computing
- **This project will be focused on equitable compute and distributing that**


### Automation

This section includes projects and an approach that enhances other learning pipelines. Projects may include:
- Building AI-Driven Automation Pipelines
- Self-Healing Pipelines
- Multi-Cloud CI/CD Pipelines
- Automation of Compliance Testing
- Optimizing code layout 
- Event-Driven CI/CD Pipelines

## Installation

This repo is more conceptual, likely won't be much code, that can be stored in a code repo later.
