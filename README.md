## About

Optimization will likely be intertwined between project interests, but this branch will be my interpretation of technical topics, and general foundation in optimization tools to apply.
Such methods to explore applications directly would be: 
~ Hyperparameter tuning
~ ROC Curve Optimization
~ Cross-Validation
~ Monte Carlo Simulations

More case specific applications: 
~ Applying Reliability Block Diagrams and Fault Tree Analysis for data center reliability modeling
  ~ This can later be further optimized through various modeling techniques, and for data center cooling system reliability analysis.
  


The first area would be spacial optimization and visualizing interconnectedness between grid components. In addition, it would be ensuring there are local and micro grids established in various locations that could minimize reliance on hydrocarbons.

Another application would be reducing peaks, finding combinations that result in peaks, and suggesting ways to create a smoother demand curve.

## Demo

The first article read and used to structure off of is (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9599719). Will also include an annotated bibliography to provide structure.
