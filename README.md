## About
This branch is thinking of ai applications relative to intersts/problems I am exploring.

Agents: focuses on applications of agents to solve tasks, and iterate through a dataset for improvmements, and forecast issues/bugs aheads of time.
An example would be an agent that could combine a multi-factor analysis to predict peaks in database in advance, and see if there is energy covered to maintain this level, perhaps including a monte-carlo analysis.
