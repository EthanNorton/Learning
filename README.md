# Projects

This will contain various projects learned in courses and my own interests. As this is the first branch in the learning sector, it will start as more of a foundation for energy, and the other branches may be moved here later.

## About

This will include: sources with an annotated bibliography, my own thoughts, feature engineering, my ideal dataset then if I can find an accessible one, and then bring in various branches off of this one, if it doesn't conflict with main. 

## Demo



## Features (in this order of operations):

Guideline: https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorial/machine-learning-steps

- Literature review, domain knowledge context **commonly ommited, why get data and choose a project if some endgoal is not in mind, this can be a guideline for the rest of the project** 
- Preprocess a dataset (clean, visualize, data quality)
- Feature Engineering
- Building a model
  - Iterating
  - Robustness checks
- Optimization, Parameter Tuning, Model Evaluation
- Implementations, Policy Analysis 
- Applying an agent to help maintain, optimize, and other ways to expand once better understanding how those work.
