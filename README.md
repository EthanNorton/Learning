## About
This branch is thinking of ai applications relative to interests/problems I am exploring, and getting a better understanding of deep learning applications.

Agents: focuses on applications of agents to solve tasks, and iterate through a dataset for improvements, and forecast issues/bugs aheads of time.
An example would be an agent that could combine a multi-factor analysis to predict peaks in database in advance, and see if there is energy covered to maintain this level, perhaps including a monte-carlo analysis.

Training/ fitting an Autoencoder: A good application of applying an autoencoder would be helping stabilize the energy fluxes, predict anamolies, and minimize future deviations. 
## Demo

First step is understanding how to train a neural network. Working through understanding this channel:
