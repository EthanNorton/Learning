# Projects

This project is structured around a foundation of optimization applications, that will built upon as I grow in that direction. The dataset used currently is synthetic as I am exploring areas and will substitute if I find a dataset that is close enough to interests.

## About

Optimization will likely be intertwined between project interests, but this branch will be my interpretation of technical topics, and general foundation in optimization tools to apply.
Such methods to explore applications directly would be: 
- Hyperparameter tuning
- ROC Curve Optimization
- Cross-Validation
- Monte Carlo Simulations

More case specific applications: 
- Applying Reliability Block Diagrams and Fault Tree Analysis for data center reliability modeling
  - This can later be further optimized through various modeling techniques, and for data center cooling system reliability analysis.
  


The first area would be spacial optimization and visualizing interconnectedness between grid components. In addition, it would be ensuring there are local and micro grids established in various locations that could minimize reliance on hydrocarbons.

Another application would be reducing peaks, finding combinations that result in peaks, and suggesting ways to create a smoother demand curve.

## Demo and other examples 

The first article read and used to structure off of is (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9599719). Will also include an annotated bibliography to provide structure.


## Features and Applications 


- Peak Reduction, Baseload Stability 
- Hydrocarbon minimization
- Grid Reliability
  - Incorporating microgrid

## Installation

1. Refer to in the requirements in requirements.txt
2. Have preprocessed data that follows these steps https://www.kdnuggets.com/2023/08/7-steps-mastering-data-cleaning-preprocessing-techniques.html **highly recommend reading through and constructing an annotated bibliography to have domain knowledge for feature engineering/blend literature and intuition.** 
3. Brief interview of Monte Carlo Analysis https://pbpython.com/monte-carlo.html, or in general, a study of optimization topic. 
   - Here is a more applied one to the problem (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544219301616)
