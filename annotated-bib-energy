# Outline 

Target Independent Variable:
-Grid Reliability more important than energy efficiency(not 100% yet)
  -Discuss why reliable over energy efficiency, pros and cons  
      -Discuss up to a certain point i.e. perhaps eventually the margin benefit of reliability will not be worth efficiency tradeoffs, etc.

Dependent Variables:
-MG Generation Options, grid vs generator power
  -Microgrid Island Mode benefits
-Energy Storage System Features 
-Power System Frequency 
-Controller System Impact(?)
-Cybersecurity in relation to distributed or centralized grid (!)
-Maintance frequency and optimization (!)
  -Could relate/balance out reliability and tune these to find reliability equilibrium in respect to efficiency, perhaps interactive variable here. 
-Disaster Recovery Method 
-Ability to handle weather variability
-Minimization of redundancy
  -Evaluation of Interconnectedness 
-Incorporation of Base to Peakload Analysis variable 
-Amount of Backup energy/accessibility to a microgrid 
-Transformers(?) 
-Understanding grid infrastruture more
