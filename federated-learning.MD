Enhance the security of federated learning by using functional programming's strong type systems and modular approach to enforce secure and privacy-preserving computations.

### Key Steps:
- **Data Security with FP**: Use functional programming to enhance privacy by ensuring that sensitive data is immutable and does not leak between services.
- **Apply Strong Type Systems**: Enforce contracts in your code to ensure that only valid, encrypted data is processed by each node in the federated learning system.
- **Use Encryption in Cloud**: Leverage **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** or **Google Cloud KMS** to manage encryption and data privacy.

### Relevant Courses:
- **MSDS 435: Machine Learning and Security** - Dive into how machine learning models can incorporate privacy and security, and how FP can play a role in secure computations.
