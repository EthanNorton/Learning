   - Become comfortable with defect management and tracking using tools like **JIRA** and **TestRail**.
   
2. **Bug Tracking and Reporting**:
   - Use **JIRA** or similar tools to log bugs, track test results, and generate reports.
   - Understand the process of communicating defects to developers and stakeholders.

3. **Basic Python Scripting**:
   - Start learning **Python** for simple automation tasks.
   - Understand Functional Programming, pytest, and other python additions. 

4. **Basic Automation with Selenium**:
   - Begin using **Selenium** to automate browser actions.
   - Write simple automated test scripts for tasks like filling forms and navigating web pages.

#### **Practical Projects**:
- Test a small web application or website and manually document any bugs or defects.
- Write Python scripts to automate a simple task like searching on Google using **Selenium**.

#### **Focus Areas**:
1. **Advanced Automation with Selenium**:
   - Automate more complex scenarios such as file uploads, handling dynamic web content, and cross-browser testing.
   - Learn to create **Page Object Models (POM)** for better-organized test scripts.

2. **Test Automation Frameworks**:
   - Build structured test automation frameworks using **PyTest** or **UnitTest**.
   - Learn how to parameterize test cases to run with different sets of data.

3. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Learn how to integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipelines using **Jenkins**, **GitLab CI**, or **Azure DevOps**.
   - Automate test execution during every code commit or deployment.
   
4. **Version Control**:
   - Use **Git** to manage test scripts and collaborate with other team members.

#### **Practical Projects**:
- Automate end-to-end testing for a small web application (login, forms, file uploads).
- Set up a **Jenkins** pipeline that automatically runs test scripts on every code commit.
