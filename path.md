   - Automate test execution during every code commit or deployment

4. **Version Control**
   - Use Git to manage test scripts and collaborate with other team members

### Practical Projects
- Automate end-to-end testing for a small web application (login, forms, file uploads)
- Set up a Jenkins pipeline that automatically runs test scripts on every code commit

### Resources

4. **Introduction to Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
   - Explore how Reinforcement Learning works by understanding agents, rewards, states, and policies
   - Apply RL to decision-making systems where agents learn optimal actions over time

### Practical Projects
- Use Python to simulate a basic Markov Chain for predicting states in a system
- Implement a simple Reinforcement Learning agent using OpenAI Gym

   - Integrate reinforcement learning models to enable systems that can learn from errors and improve over time

### Practical Projects
- Build a predictive model using TensorFlow to forecast system failures or optimize performance
- Develop a small self-healing system where an automated process detects issues and resolves them autonomously using machine learning

## Conclusion

This learning plan provides a gradual, deep learning path that transitions from QA fundamentals to advanced automation, and ultimately into stochastic processes and intelligent systems. Each phase is extended to give ample time to build and apply knowledge in real-world scenarios, while developing skill sets for future roles in machine learning, AI, or systems optimization.
Here are some additional steps:
**Study Focus**:
- Prioritize Python and SQL: Solidify data manipulation and querying skills. This will be done in the Leetcode video. 
- Cloud Platforms & ETL Tools: Dive into AWS (S3, Redshift) or Azure, and build small data pipelines using tools like Apache Airflow or SSIS.
   - **This will be covered is MSDS 434**
- Big Data Tools: Learn Spark and Kafka, focusing on integrating them into data pipelines.
- Data Modeling: Practice schema design, indexing, and normalization with Redshift or Snowflake.
- Projects: May plug in to kaggle or study there if enough expertise is built.

**Other areas to focus and improve**:
- Data Structures: Strengthen knowledge in more advanced structures like heaps, tries, and balanced trees (e.g., AVL, Red-Black).
- Algorithms: Focus on sorting, searching, graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's, Kruskalâ€™s), and dynamic programming.
- Operating Systems: Understanding threading, concurrency, and memory management can be helpful.
- Networking: Concepts like protocols (TCP/IP), sockets, and RESTful APIs.
- System Design: Grasping high-level architecture, scalability, and distributed systems design (like load balancing, caching, and database sharding) is crucial for backend and data engineering roles.
