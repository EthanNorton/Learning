# README: Bridging Functional Programming, Cloud Computing, and Federated Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on exploring how **Functional Programming (FP)** principles can be applied to **Cloud Computing** and **Federated Learning**. It highlights the key steps for building stateless cloud functions using FP, developing scalable microservices, deploying federated learning simulations, and ensuring security through modular code. The following sections will guide you through the steps to bridge these concepts and tie them together for efficient, scalable solutions.

## 1. Understanding Stateless Systems

### Objective:
Learn how to develop stateless cloud functions using functional programming paradigms.

### Key Steps:
- **Deploy Stateless Cloud Functions**: Start by building and deploying simple stateless functions in **AWS Lambda** or **Google Cloud Functions**.
  - https://redis.io/glossary/stateful-vs-stateless-architectures/ first start to evaluate this step. 
  - https://fingent.com/blog/functional-programming-or-microservices-what-suits-your-business-app-development/ - blends together this into next step, FP. 
- **Functional Programming Principles**: Implement core FP principles like immutability and pure functions in your cloud functions to make them reliable and scalable.
- **Ensure Idempotency**: Cloud functions should produce the same result regardless of how many times they're executed.

### Relevant Courses:
- **MSDS 434: Data Science and Cloud Computing** - Covers cloud architecture and services like AWS Lambda, which is key for developing and deploying stateless functions.

## 5. Exploring Privacy and Security

### Objective:
Enhance the security of federated learning by using functional programming's strong type systems and modular approach to enforce secure and privacy-preserving computations.

### Key Steps:
- **Data Security with FP**: Use functional programming to enhance privacy by ensuring that sensitive data is immutable and does not leak between services.
- **Apply Strong Type Systems**: Enforce contracts in your code to ensure that only valid, encrypted data is processed by each node in the federated learning system.
- **Use Encryption in Cloud**: Leverage **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** or **Google Cloud KMS** to manage encryption and data privacy.

### Relevant Courses:
- **MSDS 485**
  - In this course, we are exploring differences between ways to balance privacy, efficiency, incentives, and other areas..
    - Connected this to federated learning, as we discussed topics related to the Attention Economy.
